# Technical Analysis Patterns

This directory contains documentation for various technical analysis patterns implemented in the `patterns` package.

## Overview

The pattern detection system analyzes candlestick data to identify various technical chart patterns. These patterns are used to predict potential price movements and market trends.

## Pattern Categories

### Reversal Patterns
- [Head and Shoulders](reversal/head_and_shoulders.md)
- [Inverse Head and Shoulders](reversal/inverse_head_and_shoulders.md)
- [Double Top](reversal/double_top.md)
- [Double Bottom](reversal/double_bottom.md)
- [Rounding Bottom](reversal/rounding_bottom.md)

### Continuation Patterns
- [Triangle Patterns](continuation/triangles.md)
- [Flags and Pennants](continuation/flags_pennants.md)

## Implementation Details

### Common Features
- Percentage-based thresholds (typically 3%) for level comparisons
- Pattern confirmation through breakout/breakdown
- Minimum candle requirements
- Error checking and validation
- Integration with existing Candle struct

### Data Structures

```go
type Candle struct {
    Open   float64
    High   float64
    Low    float64
    Close  float64
    Volume float64
    Time   time.Time
}

type PatternResult struct {
    Pattern     string  // Name of the pattern
    Confidence  float64 // Confidence level (0.0 to 1.0)
    Description string  // Description of the pattern
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Pattern Confirmation**
   - Always wait for pattern confirmation through breakout/breakdown
   - Use volume confirmation when available
   - Consider market context and timeframe

2. **Risk Management**
   - Use stop-loss orders based on pattern structure
   - Consider pattern size for position sizing
   - Monitor for pattern failure

3. **Timeframe Considerations**
   - Patterns on higher timeframes are more reliable
   - Consider multiple timeframe analysis
   - Be aware of pattern duration

## Limitations

1. **False Signals**
   - Not all patterns lead to expected outcomes
   - Market conditions can invalidate patterns
   - Need additional confirmation

2. **Timeframe Dependencies**
   - Pattern reliability varies by timeframe
   - Longer timeframes generally more reliable
   - Consider market context

3. **Market Conditions**
   - Patterns work best in trending markets
   - Less reliable in choppy or ranging markets
   - Consider overall market conditions

## Future Improvements

1. **Volume Analysis**
   - Add volume confirmation
   - Volume profile analysis
   - Volume trend analysis

2. **Pattern Combinations**
   - Multiple pattern confirmation
   - Pattern failure detection
   - Pattern strength measurement

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Pattern recognition accuracy improvement
   - False signal reduction
   - Dynamic threshold adjustment
